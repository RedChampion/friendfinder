### Purpose and Usefulness
Let's say you just relocated to a new city where you don't know anybody. You want to meet new people and make connections that might lead to friendship, but we all know it can be hard to bridge the gap of stranger -> acquaintance -> friend. This is where FriendFinder comes in. It is a simple application where users can take a short survey about personality traits and interests that will help match them up with other FriendFinder users that answered the survey similarly.
